## Objective
In this project, we are tasked to create our very own restaurant page in order to familiarize ourselves with the workaround of webpack. Rather than manually taking care of the dependencies, we have to automate the file and assets management with the help of npm and webpack. We are also enforced to make use of ES6 modules to maximize the maintainability of the codebase.
